<strong> Summary </strong>

While paper and pen certainly work, it is a nice transition to go from a written expense list to an app like this one. I only 
ever <em>"wrote"</em> my expenses down or lightly used excel spreadsheet to display them in the past. After working my way through the interesting process of 
building this app, I will be using it to track all my expenses.
